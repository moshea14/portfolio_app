            Hello, my name is Matthew O'Shea and I'm an up and coming fullstack developer. Currently I am in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp learning how to become the best coder I can be. I also went to Kean University for my finance degree. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and I'm looking forward to learning and growing as a developer. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source communities. I believe in continuous learning and strive to improve my skills every day. My goal is to build impactful software solutions that can make a difference in people's lives. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, playing video games, or spending time with family and friends. I'm passionate about technology and excited to see what the future holds.
